# D-D_Bot

This is a discord bot that I am using for my weekly D&D games. 

The goal was to replace the multiple bots that I was using before.

Current functionality:
- Dice rolling (command !r or !roll)
- Some conversational prompts (example: 'hey, bot')

TODO functionality:
- Play audio in voice channel
  - Play by location/event
  - Pause/Play/Skip/Queue ability
